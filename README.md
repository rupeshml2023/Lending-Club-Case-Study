2)Loans with Grade have interest rate charge of under 5%-10%.
3)The Mean value denotes the Recoveries tend to be higher in all Loan grades other than Loan Grade”A”
Thus denoting any loan applicantcatgorized under Grade B to E have higher chances of Loan turning out to be charged off and hence end with recoveries.
